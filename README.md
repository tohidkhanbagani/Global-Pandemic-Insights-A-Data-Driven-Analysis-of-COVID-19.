Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on cases, deaths, tests, and vaccinations. The analysis explores trends over time, geographical variations, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes two CSV files:

COVID DEATHS.csv
COVID_VACCINATIONS.csv
The data is cleaned, merged, and transformed for analysis.

Analysis
The analysis covers the following aspects:

Data Exploration: Initial dataset exploration, including shape, information, and duplicate checks.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.
Data Transformation: Creating new features and formatting data for analysis.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Calculating total cases, deaths, tests, vaccinations, and percentage changes over time.
Visualizations: Creating various visualizations to understand trends in cases, deaths, tests, and vaccinations.
Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and removing outliers in cases and death data.
Metrics Analysis: Calculating and visualizing average percentage changes in cases and deaths by year.
Geographical Analysis: Analyzing data by continent and country, including population affected, tested, and dead percentages.
Top Countries Analysis: Identifying and analyzing the top 10 countries by cases and deaths.
Code Structure
The code is organized into the following sections:

Import Libraries: Imports necessary data manipulation, analysis, and visualization libraries.
Data Loading: Loads the dataset from CSV files.
Data Cleaning: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
Data Transformation: Transforms the data for analysis.
KPI Calculation: Calculates key performance indicators.
Visualization: Creates various visualizations.
Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifies and removes outliers.
Metrics Analysis: Calculates and visualizes metrics.
Geographical Analysis: Analyzes data by continent and country.
Top Countries Analysis: Analyzes top 10 countries.
Usage
To run the code:

Clone the repository.
Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
Ensure the dataset CSV files are in the same directory as the code.
Run the Python script.
